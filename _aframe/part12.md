title: 'Lesson 12: Making your own component'
---

If you want to extend the functionality of your application beyond what you can do with the argon-aframe tags, then you need to write some javascript on your own.  One way to do this is to add an eventlistener, as discussed in Lesson 4. A second way is to make your own component (with the javascript code inside defining how the component with act). This method is provided by aframe, and you can see the documentation for it [here](http://aframe.io/docs) Argon-aframe will work with the component exactly as you made it for aframe.
